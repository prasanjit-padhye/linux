Steps involved in completing the assignment

    Download and install VMware workstation
    Download ubuntu iso file
    Create a ubuntu virtual machine on vmware workstation.
    Setup Ubuntu selecting 200 GB of space and 5gb of memory
    Go into settings of the virtual machine and in the processor section , check the checkboxes for virtualization capabilities
    Fork the original linux repository from torvalds/linux into your github
    In the ubuntu virtual machine terminal run the command cat /proc/cpuinfo to check that vmx flags are present and virtualization capabilities are present for the VM.
    Install git on the VM by using the command "sudo apt-get-install git"
    Clone the repository which we forked earlier from torvalds/linux
    Run cd linux to siwtch to the repo which we just cloned
    In the cmpe283-1.c file downloaded from canvas add the sections of code for primary procbased controls, secondary procbased controls, entry and exit controls after referring to the SDM volume 3 module 23.6.x and 23.7 and 23.8.
    Add the modified cmpe283-1.c file and the Makefile to a folder cmpe283 and put the folder under the cloned linux directory
    switch to the linux directory
    Run "uname -a" command to check the version (check if there is a version mismatch between the cloned version and the current vm linux distribution we are running)
    In order to run certain make commmands we need to run certain install commands "sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev flex bison openssl libssl-dev dkms libelf-dev libudev-dev libpci-dev libiberty-dev autoconf"
    Follow the following sequence of commands to build and install the kernel modules
    "make menuconfig" (do not save any changes in the UI and exit it )
    "cp /boot/config-{curent version we got from "uname -a" command without braces} .config"
    "make oldconfig" (press enter to answer all the questions)
    "make prepare"
    "make -j {no. of cores on the processor} modules" eg : "make -j 4 modules"
    If there is an error similar to"*** No rule to make target 'debian/canonical-certs.pem'"
    vi the .config file and set the system trusted keys and revocation keys strings = ""
    after the "make -j 4 modules" command is sucessfuly finished
    "make -j 4"
    After this command is succesfully finished we will see a "is ready" statement in the end
    "sudo make INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 modules_install"
    "sudo make install"
    "sudo reboot"
    run "uname -a" to check that the version has changed (updated to our new complied module)
    change directory to the drectory we created earlier "cd cmpe283"
    run "make" command check if there are any errors in the file or an error asking to include license. In case of an error for license, go to the cmpe283-1.c file and at the botton add "MODULE_LICENSE("GPL v2");" and save the file.
    After the make command is successfuly executed run , check that the .ko file is created using "lsmod | grep cmpe283"
    "sudo insmod cmpe283-1.ko" to insert our module
    Run "dmesg" command to check
    We can see the capability info for all the MSR which we have defined in the cmpe283-1.c file undr the heading "CMPE 283 Assignment 1 Module Start"
    To remove the module run "sudo rmmmod cmpe283-1"
    run "dmesg" to check the exit message ""CMPE 283 Assignment 1 Module Exits"
